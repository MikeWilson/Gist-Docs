# Gist

Gist is a documentation tool for Figma made by [@mk_wlsn](https://twitter.com/mk_wlsn)



## Why?

Gist was built to document design systems in Figma. As a designer, I found it frustrating to have to leave my working file and dig through a Figma file to find documentation for a component.

\
Gist solves this by attaching the documentation *to* the component. Meaning that your designers have access to component docs in their working file as they are using the component.
