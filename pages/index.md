# Gist

Gist is a documentation tool for Figma. Gist was made to document design systems. As a designer, itâ€™s frustrating to have to leave the working file and search the web or a Figma file for component documentation.



Gist solves this by attaching the documentation *to* the component. Meaning that your designers have access to component docs in their working file as they are using the component.
