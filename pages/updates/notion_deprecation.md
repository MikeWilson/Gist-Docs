# Announcing Notion Deprecation

On 5/5/2024 I am discontinuing the Notion linking feature in the Gist plugin due to technical constraints and lack of usage. The Notion API does not support CORS which which significantly limits the potential for linking and publishing features in an app like Gist. The analytics indicate no usage of this feature, reinforcing the decision to focus on more impactful areas of the plugin.
