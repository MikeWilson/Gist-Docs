# Announcing Notion Deprecation


On 5/5/2024 I am discontinuing the Notion linking feature in the Gist plugin due to technical constraints and lack of usage. Their API does not support CORS which which significantly limits the potential for linking and publishing features in an app like Gist. My analytics indicates no usage of this feature, reinforcing the decision to focus on more impactful areas of the plugin.


Thank you for your continued support of the Gist plugin.
